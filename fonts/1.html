                        <h2 class="_-Level-2-Heading">Austrade's international network</h2>
                        <p>Austrade provides information, advice and services to Australian businesses, education institutions, tourism operators, governments and citizens. Across its purposes, Austrade contributes to Australia's economic prosperity through its trade promotion and investment attraction activities, promotion of Australia as an international study destination, and by connecting tourism attraction and tourism policy advice and advocacy with its wider spectrum of work.</p>
                        <p>At 30 June 2018, Austrade’s network
                            comprised 122 physical locations, including
                            10 offices in major Australian centres, which
                            are complemented by 28 TradeStart offices.
                            Overseas, Austrade operates in 49 markets with
                            84 points of presence, 14 of which also provide
                            consular services. In addition to these locations,
                            Austrade has established Landing Pads in
                            San Francisco, Tel Aviv, Shanghai, Singapore
                            and Berlin, which are in separate locations to
                            Austrade offices.</p>
                        <p>As part of its organisational restructure during
                            2017–18, Austrade’s international network now
                            consists of seven regional groupings: Americas,
                            ASEAN and Pacific, Europe, Greater China,
                            Middle East and Africa, North East Asia, and
                            South Asia.</p>
                        <h3 class="_-body-copy ParaOverride-20">Americas</h3>
                        <p>During the year, Austrade restructured its activities in the Americas, combining North and South American posts under a single leadership. This ‘pole to pole’ approach has allowed skills and knowledge to be shared more easily across the region, while maintaining a focus on market diversity and specialisation, which remains critically important to individual markets. Posts in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Peru, Chile, Colombia, Argentina and Brazil now deliver a combined presence in the region that better reflects the activities of transnational clients, creating benefits for both trade and investment outcomes. </p>
                        <p>The combined economic strength of this region, which approaches one billion people, ranges from developing economies that offer significant inbound trade and education opportunities for Australia, to substantial foreign direct investment (FDI) initiatives in North America. </p>
                        <p>With the signing of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP-11) in Santiago in March 2018, Australia joins with Canada, Chile, Mexico and Peru in the Americas—alongside Asian partners and New Zealand—in continuing its support for free trade in the face of protectionist pressures. </p>
                        <p>In addition, the signing of the Peru–Australia Free Trade Agreement in February 2018, against the backdrop of Australia’s ongoing free trade agreement negotiations with the members of the Pacific Alliance (Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru), will provide Australian businesses with an opportunity to expand their trade with this emerging market.</p>
                        <p>Significant FDI outcomes in the North American market included Austrade assisting Medline, the world-leading manufacturer and distributor of medical supplies, to open a major distribution centre in Western Sydney, employing up to 500 people. Austrade also worked closely with Yamaha Motor Ventures in establishing a significant global venture capital fund managed out of Australia. </p>
                        <p>In Colombia, education outcomes were strong, with over 14,000 Colombian students enrolled in Australia in 2017, a 26 per cent year-on-year improvement.<sup id="fn_034-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#fn_034">1</a></sup></p>
                        <p>In Brazil, Austrade facilitated close cooperation between the Australian Digital Health Agency and the Brazilian Ministry of Health on advancing digital health. </p>
                        <p>With the release of its Defence Export Strategy, the Australian Government will provide additional funding from 2018–19 to achieve greater export success for Australian defence industries. Austrade intensified its efforts to identify and build relations with potential partners in the United States in the military and law enforcement, and in defence and dual-use technology companies, working closely with the Department of Defence and other Australian Government agencies. </p>
                        <h3 class="_-body-copy ParaOverride-20"><em>Business missions and exchanges</em></h3>
                        <p>In February 2018, Austrade once again partnered with Australian Cyber Security Growth Network Limited—AustCyber—to deliver a mission of some 65 participants from 44 Australian companies to the world-leading RSA cybersecurity conference in San Francisco. </p>
                        <p>Austrade New York successfully sponsored the Australian Blockchain Mission to the Consensus conference in May 2018 in partnership with the Australian Digital Commerce Association, CSIRO’s Data 61 and the NSW Government. </p>
                        <p>In March 2018, Austrade partnered with Tourism Australia and Sounds Australia, under the G’Day USA banner, to participate in the South by Southwest creative and digital technology conference in Austin, Texas. </p>
                        <p>Also in March 2018, Austrade led a 25-member agtech delegation to San Francisco and the mid-west, while the first-ever Australian business mission to Ecuador took place in November 2017. </p>
                        <p>With an improving business environment and a return to growth in Chile, Austrade successfully curated Australian participation at Chile’s international mining convention, Expomin 2018, with 41 companies in attendance. </p>
                        <p>In November 2017, Austrade—in partnership with the Argentinian and Chilean governments— announced the winners of the Agtech Passport exchange program and launched the METStech Passport exchange program. These startup programs are designed to fuel the commercialisation of technology and ideas between Australia and Latin America in agriculture and mining equipment, technology and services. </p>
                        <h3 class="_-body-copy ParaOverride-20">ASEAN and Pacific</h3>
                        <p>In 2017, Australia’s trade with ASEAN countries grew by 9 per cent compared to 2016, reaching $105 billion. </p>
                        <p>During the year, Austrade provided advice and assistance to over 1,500 Australian companies across this diverse and complex region. Exports of food and agricultural products; education and training; and equipment, technology and services for the resources sector all grew strongly. </p>
                        <p>At present, 20.5 per cent of Australian food and agricultural exports go to ASEAN. These are growing at around 7 per cent per annum, especially into large emerging middle-class markets in the region. In partnership with the Victorian Government, Horticulture Innovation Australia and industry peak bodies, Austrade has been expanding the channels to market for Australian citrus and grapes in the Philippines, not only through retail and food service, but also by organising fresh produce pop-ups at major Australian and international company sites in Manila. </p>
                        <p>Austrade works with services and technology companies to capture opportunities as markets develop in this resource-rich region. In Malaysia, the Global Value Chain program with the national oil company is opening doors for Australian exporters’ innovative solutions, services and technologies in the oil and gas sector. During 2017–18, Austrade supported Digatex, a digital asset engineering company, to connect with these opportunities. Through close Austrade engagement, Digatex undertook virtual meetings, culminating in a workshop to showcase its digital technologies, laying the groundwork for future commercial engagement. </p>
                        <p>Austrade runs programs that broaden and deepen Australia’s recruitment pool for international education. In Indonesia, Austrade ran a ‘Science Your Future’ campaign across key urban areas to increase interest in studying science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects in Australia. Partnering with the Australian Technology Network of universities, Qantas and BlueScope Steel, the campaign linked technical skills to Australian education expertise, aiming to increase recruitment into STEM courses in Australia. </p>
                        <p>In Singapore, Austrade supported more than 22 Australian scaleups through its Landing Pad initiative, including Anatomics and CEC Systems, who were able to finalise commercial agreements in Singapore during their three months in the program. Austrade’s Landing Pad also organised an agtech ‘boot camp’ for SproutX, Australia’s largest agtech accelerator and co-working space, in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. With this support, SproutX announced the formation of an Asia Pacific Agtech Alliance, based out of Singapore. </p>
                        <p>Austrade focuses on helping Australian businesses understand and capitalise on commercial opportunities in ASEAN. In December 2017, Austrade and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade launched the ASEAN Now report on key trends and opportunities in the region. This publication is part of Austrade’s commitment to share our commercial insights with Australian business, including small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), to help them successfully expand into new international markets. </p>
                        <p>In March 2018, the then Prime Minister, the Hon Malcolm Turnbull MP, hosted the first ever ASEAN–Australia Special Summit in Sydney. Austrade contributed to this major government priority by helping plan, support and deliver the summit’s business program. Austrade engaged with over 300 SME delegates and 120 leading ASEAN and Australian CEOs to ensure successful summit outcomes and enhanced business connections. ASEAN and Australian CEO leaders discussed regional challenges and opportunities across six important areas: agrifood supply chain logistics; advanced manufacturing and Industry 4.0; digital transformation in services; future energy supply chains; infrastructure; and aviation and tourism. </p>
                        <p>As the region develops, leading local businesses are increasingly looking to diversify through investing outside their home markets. Austrade has a small specialist team targeting and facilitating investment from the region, with economic and tourism infrastructure, food and agriculture, and resources and energy sectors attracting most interest from ASEAN investors. In 2017, Austrade supported Dutch Mill, one of Thailand’s largest manufacturers and marketers of dairy products, through site visits and introductions to both Australian government and industry representatives. The company subsequently invested in the Edith Creek milk processing factory in Tasmania, saving the factory from closure and rescuing local jobs. </p>
                        <p>The Pacific continues to be a strong market for Australian exporters. Austrade is focused on identifying new opportunities emerging in the region, particularly in tropical infrastructure in the Pacific, and oil and gas opportunities within the resources sector in Papua New Guinea (PNG). In 2017–18, Austrade assisted Bunnings to develop a Pacific strategy to supply major infrastructure projects, and Saunders International to supply bulk storage tanks to large mining projects in PNG. </p>
                        <p>The internal restructure resulting in the creation of Austrade’s ASEAN and Pacific regional grouping has also enabled regionally coordinated initiatives for 2018–19. Activity will be directed towards promoting the emerging growth sectors: medtech and digital health; cybersecurity and fintech; and smart cities and infrastructure, in addition to continuing to support growing business opportunities in core sectors of food and agriculture, resources and energy, and education and training. </p>

                        <h3 class="_-Level-3-Heading">Europe</h3>
                        <p>Austrade’s Europe group covers all the markets within the European Union (EU), as well as non-EU countries in Europe, Israel, and the Commonwealth of Independent States (including Russia). </p>
                        <p>Within this region, Austrade focuses on the delivery of services relating to a range of trade, investment and education programs across a total of 13 offices in Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Spain, Poland, Russia, Czech Republic, Israel, Switzerland and Sweden. </p>
                        <p>The European Union includes four of the world’s largest economies and, as a whole, accounts for 16.5 per cent of global trade. The already strong relationship between Australia and the European Union will be enhanced by the successful conclusion of free trade agreement negotiations, which began in June 2018. </p>
                        <p>The United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union is scheduled to take effect at the end of March 2019, with the process being completed at the end of 2020. While the future UK–EU trade relationship remains uncertain, the United Kingdom’s stated intention of leaving the EU customs union and single market will create new barriers for trade and investment between the European Union and the United Kingdom, which could give rise to shifts in commercial operations, presenting both opportunities and frictions for Australian companies. </p>
                        <p>Within the established markets of the European Union, Austrade’s principal focus of operations during 2017–18 was on the delivery of FDI flows into targeted areas of the Australian economy. During the year, a total of 49 inward investment projects were concluded, which will contribute more than $2.7 billion in FDI flows to the Australian economy, creating or safeguarding nearly 15,000 jobs. </p>
                        <p>Concluded projects involved FDI into a number of priority sectors, with the largest investment flows attracted into the agribusiness and food, resources and energy, and major infrastructure sectors. The majority of ongoing FDI projects and new activities in 2018–19 will be focused on attraction and facilitation of digital and transformative technology–focused investment. </p>
                        <p>During the year, Austrade also continued to support Australian exporters by coordinating participation in major industry conferences and exhibitions, and through targeted engagement with major customer groups across a range of industries (see case study on this page). </p>
                        <p>The Government’s defence procurement and export strategies expanded the platform for continued engagement between European prime contractors and Australian industry during the year, through commercial linkages stimulated by the awarding of more than $130 billion in major long-term contracts to European companies, including Naval Group for the Future Submarine Program, BAE Systems for the Future Frigate Program, Lürssen for the Offshore Patrol Vessels project, and Rheinmetall for the delivery of the new Combat Reconnaissance Vehicle. </p>
                        <p>Austrade worked closely with the Department of Defence, state and territory representatives, and members of the Australian defence industry to identify and connect Australian defence capability and capacity with these and other major European prime contractors and defence suppliers. </p>
                        <p>This work will continue as Austrade’s European posts play a role in the ongoing rollout of the Government’s Defence Export Strategy, with posts in the United Kingdom, France and Germany enhancing their focus and resourcing to the sector. </p>
                        <p>Beyond these markets, Austrade is also active in supporting Australian defence exporters and is providing ongoing support to more than 20 Australian exporters as they pursue opportunities associated with the $45 billion Polish defence modernisation program. </p>
                        <div class="case-study">
                            <h3>Barcelona smart cities mission</h3>
                            <p>The Barcelona Smart City Expo World Congress (SCEWC) is one of the peak global events for the smart city industry. More than 18,000 participants, 675 exhibitors, speakers, technical experts and political representatives from more than 700 cities and 120 countries attended this flagship industry event in 2017. The congress hosts world-leading innovative smart city thought leaders, and the Expo Area showcases projects and solutions to countries, cities, universities, investors and businesses from around the world. </p>
                            <p>The 2017 SCEWC was held from 14–16 November and offered Australian companies the opportunity to connect with global smart city leaders across governance, economy, society, sustainability, mobility, safety, and information and communications technology. Austrade led a mission of 26 Australian companies to the congress, and was acknowledged as a key event partner by the event organisers. </p>
                            <p>In addition to three-day access to the conference, the Austrade-led mission included exclusive networking opportunities throughout the week with major-market commercial leaders and smart city influencers, and an additional program of business activities in Barcelona. </p>
                            <p>A highlight was an event hosted by the City of Lyon, the City of Munich and Austrade and moderated by the Smart Cities Council Australia New Zealand. </p>
                            <p><img alt="Chris Oldfield, Senior Trade Commissioner and Consul-General, San Francisco, pictured with Bennett Merriman, Event Workforce Group, at the San Francisco Landing Pad.

                        <h3 class="_-Level-3-Heading">Greater China</h3>
                        <p>In 2017–18, Greater China continued to provide Australian businesses with significant commercial opportunities across trade, investment, international education and the tourism sector. </p>
                        <p>Australia’s bilateral trade with mainland China reached $183 billion in 2017, an increase of 16.1 per cent over the previous year.<sup id="fn_033-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#fn_033">2</a></sup></p>
                        <p>Now in its third year, the China–Australia Free Trade Agreement continues to deliver outcomes for Australian exporters, with some products experiencing significant growth in volumes to the China market. For example, Australian wine exports to China reached $1.12 billion in 2017–18, an increase of 55 per cent year on year.<sup id="fn_032-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#fn_032">3</a></sup></p>
                        <p>Austrade’s priority sectors in China include food and beverage, agribusiness, health and medical, financial services, education, and infrastructure. </p>
                        <p>Austrade is also enabling greater collaboration in innovation and entrepreneurship, assisting startup firms to understand the China market through a program of mentoring and market entry information via the Shanghai Landing Pad. </p>
                        <p>Week-long intensive ‘boot camp’ programs are also being delivered to some of Australia’s best up-and-coming innovative firms. </p>
                        <p>In Hong Kong, Austrade is partnering with major corporates such as MTR on the Australia – Hong Kong Tech Bridge program, enabling Australian technology scaleups to embed teams into Hong Kong corporates to develop innovative solutions. </p>
                        <p>Services sector initiatives included inbound and outbound blockchain missions and the signing of cooperation agreements between Austrade and two key industry partners, the Australian Digital Commerce Association and the Blockchain Centre. </p>
                        <p>Austrade also supported health and aged care inbound missions to the AusBiotech National Conference 2017, and the Ageing Well Revolution international conference in November 2017. </p>
                        <p>Austrade continues to support the presence of Australian health and medical companies in China, such as Cochlear and CSL. Cochlear laid the foundation stone at its new research and development and manufacturing hub in Chengdu in February 2018. </p>
                        <p>Education initiatives to support returned Chinese students included careers fairs in Beijing and Shanghai, an employability forum, and the launch of the Australia China Career Success campaign by the Hon Steven Ciobo MP, the then Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment. The campaign leveraged China’s key social media vehicle WeChat to profile graduates of Australian institutions working in areas of future skills demand in China, such as e-commerce, data analytics and the creative industries. </p>
                        <p>Significant investment opportunities in northern Australia were showcased to 40 leading Chinese investor companies at the second Northern Australia Investment Forum in Cairns. Representatives from China made up the largest overseas delegation represented at the forum. </p>
                        <p>The signing of a landmark agreement between Austrade and the China Development Bank focused on financing infrastructure, agriculture, energy, tourism and innovation projects in northern Australia. The signing was witnessed by Mr Ciobo and China’s National Development and Reform Commission Vice Chairman Ning Jizhe. </p>
                        <p>Strong interest from the Taiwan banking sector saw Austrade assist seven Taiwanese banks to establish Australian operations. Austrade also partnered with Taiwan industry stakeholders to promote Australian vocational education and training expertise focused on tourism training. </p>
                        <p>Throughout Greater China, Austrade continued to support the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and other federal and state government departments with ministerial visits, including several visits by Mr Ciobo. </p>
                        <h3 class="_-Level-3-Heading">Middle East and Africa</h3>
                        <p>Austrade has 12 points of presence across 67 countries in the Middle East and Africa region. Although each country has its own geopolitical and economic complexions, economic growth is relatively uniform, with both the Middle East and North Africa, and Sub-Saharan Africa, predicted to grow at 3.1 per cent in 2018, up from 1.8 per cent and 2.6 per cent respectively in 2017. </p>
                        <p>Key trends and developments in the region that are generating opportunities for Australian business include food security and safety; transnational education; economic diversification through creating new industries and reform of underperforming industry sectors to drive sustainable economic growth and employment; and government-led economic development plans and projects, such as Expo 2020 Dubai, Saudi Vision 2030, and New Kuwait 2035. </p>
                        <p>Geopolitical developments in the Middle East and North Africa are presenting particular challenges for Australian companies, mitigated by Austrade’s assistance in key markets. The dispute between Qatar and three other Gulf Cooperation Council countries—Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain— impacted on Australian companies servicing Qatar from the region, due to logistics and commercial constraints. </p>
                        <p>The US withdrawal in May 2018 from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on Iran’s nuclear program, and its proposed sanctions on Iran, may affect Australian companies’ ability to transact with the market. Most of Australia’s trade relationship with Iran is in sectors that were not subject to previous US sanctions, such as health, education, agrifood and mining. The level of interest in this market from Australian firms and education institutions remains relatively strong, though many are seeking advice from Austrade on the potential impact of reintroduced US sanctions. </p>
                        <p>Sectoral engagement in the region is also critical to Australia’s success, with an emphasis on education, agrifood, mining, services, health and infrastructure. </p>
                        <p>The quality of Australian premium food and beverages is recognised across the region. Austrade supported Australian businesses at events such as Gulfood, and hosted the first Gourmet Australia in Africa events in Mauritius, South Africa, Kenya and Tanzania. </p>
                        <p>Dubai is a globally significant logistics and air services hub and the key distribution hub for the broader Middle East and Africa region, which has enabled the development of the Australian premium food and beverage market in the UAE and facilitated re-export to the broader region, as well as the development of a significant Australian business presence. The importance of logistics to the UAE economy has stimulated collaboration between Australia and dnata, the world’s leading aviation ground services equipment operator. Austrade worked with dnata and an Australian consortium comprising CSIRO’s Data61, University of Technology Sydney, University of Melbourne and University of Sydney to stimulate research and development collaboration in vehicle automation and robotics, and to increase efficiencies in dnata’s operating systems and processes. </p>
                        <p>In addition to traditional international student recruitment, transnational education models such as offshore campus establishment, curriculum sharing and distance learning models are becoming increasingly important in the region. The Curtin University campus in Dubai commenced its degree programs in January 2018 and joined the existing University of Wollongong Dubai and Murdoch University campuses. </p>
                        <p>Austrade has been active in the lead-up to a number of key events to be held in 2020 that will place a spotlight on the region. The UAE is Australia’s largest trade and investment partner in the Middle East and it is investing more than US$9.4 billion to host the World Expo 2020 in Dubai, which will provide a platform to promote and showcase Australian expertise, goods and services to the world. </p>
                        <p>The Middle East is home to seven of the fifteen largest sovereign wealth funds in the world. Australia has seen a steady flow of investments into major infrastructure, hotels, resources and agriculture from sovereign wealth funds and state-owned enterprises from the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar. Austrade works closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, state and territory governments and other agencies to nurture and stimulate continued investment into Australia. </p>
                        <p>Austrade is working to capture the growing interest from Africa in Australia as a high-quality study destination. In April 2018, Austrade organised a <em>Future Unlimited</em> West Africa Education Exhibition in Lagos and Abuja in Nigeria, and Accra in Ghana. More than 20 Australian institutions were represented and engaged with over 1,000 prospective students and key stakeholders. </p>

                            <p>With over six years of experience in the role of Senior Investment Manager, Dubai, Preeti Rekhari has developed Austrade’s investment strategy for the Middle East and Africa region. Sovereign wealth funds and state-owned enterprises from the six Gulf Cooperation Council countries form the cornerstone of the strategy. </p>
                            <p>Besides building an informed narrative about these investors, which aids engagement at senior government levels, Preeti also works closely with the Middle East and Africa region’s General Manager, trade commissioners, and two investment managers on an expanded regional strategy for corporates, family offices and high-net-worth individuals eligible for Austrade services. </p>
                            <p>‘The most enjoyable aspect of my job is facilitating investor visits, as these showcase how Austrade works with state and territory governments, industry associations and businesses to win investment for Australia,’ Preeti said. </p>
                            <p>With a decade of experience in trade facilitation in food, ICT and financial services prior to taking on an investment role, over the past year Preeti has also spearheaded a multi-year initiative with colleagues to understand the UAE’s innovation agenda and identify opportunities for Australian clients in fintech, blockchain, agtech and medtech. </p>

                        <h3 class="_-Level-3-Heading">North East Asia</h3>
                        <p>Austrade’s North East Asia regional grouping consists of Japan, Republic of Korea (Korea) and Mongolia. Japan and Korea represent Australia’s second- and third-largest export markets, while Japan is Australia’s second-largest investor. Both Japan and Korea are mature and dependable business partners, with a combined two-way bilateral trade value of $127 billion in 2017. <sup id="fn_031-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#fn_031">4</a></sup></p>
                        <h3 class="_-Level-3-Heading"><em>Japan</em></h3>
                        <p>As Australia’s second-largest source of FDI, Japanese investment in Australia of over $219 billion continues to diversify from its traditional base of resources and energy. The majority of FDI outcomes were across the construction, infrastructure and agriculture sectors. </p>
                        <p>The Hydrogen Energy Supply Chain (HESC) project has gathered pace, with Kawasaki Heavy Industries moving to coal-to-liquid hydrogen conversion in Victoria. The HESC pilot phase will test and demonstrate how an integrated hydrogen supply chain could operate between Australia and Japan by 2021, with the potential commercial phase around 2030. </p>
                        <p >Export successes continued across the traditional areas of food and agriculture, including growing sales of table grapes and other horticulture products. New markets were identified during the year, with Australia’s Austal signing a contract with JR Kyushu Jet Ferry to design, manufacture and deliver a $68 million, 83-metre, high-speed trimaran ferry with a 500-passenger capacity. This demonstrated Australia’s reputation for quality and innovative shipbuilding using advanced technologies. </p>
                        <h3 class="_-Level-3-Heading"><em>South Korea</em></h3>
                        <p>Australia and South Korea have a highly complementary trade relationship, reflecting the successful implementation of the Korea– Australia Free Trade Agreement, which enjoys utilisation rates above 80 per cent (by value of trade) following five rounds of tariff cuts since entry into force in 2014. </p>
                        <p>In 2017–18, Austrade assisted Cortical Dynamics to secure an international distribution agreement for its Brain Anaesthesia Response Monitor. </p>
                        <p>The agreement will see the device distributed to hospitals across Korea, where it will assist anaesthetists and intensive care staff to monitor patients under anaesthesia and to minimise the incidence of side effects. </p>
                        <p>With 90 per cent of bilateral trade being in goods, there is still plenty of scope to lift services trade. For example, during the year, Australian global fund manager IFM Investors formed a joint venture with Korean firm Samsung Asset Management to manage a global infrastructure debt fund worth $480 million. To further cultivate its Korean client base, IFM opened a Seoul office in November 2017. </p>
                        <p>The South Korean investment relationship also offers potential. While the stock of two-way investment has increased fourfold over the past decade to more than $40 billion, annual investment flows in both directions are low compared to the trading relationship. Highlights in the year included Samsung CT Corporation’s winning joint venture bid for the major M4–M5 motorway link in Sydney, due for completion in 2022. South Korean investment in new energy supply chains in Australia is set to make South Korea one of the world’s largest players in battery manufacturing and supply. POSCO, LG, Samsung and SK are also active in securing raw material supply, with POSCO taking the lead by making an $80 million direct investment in Pilbara Minerals to secure lithium. LG International and SK Innovation have closely followed, making strategic alliances with Australian mines to secure cobalt and nickel. </p>
                        <h3 class="_-Level-3-Heading"><em>Mongolia</em></h3>
                        <p>Austrade’s focus in Mongolia—an emerging economy dependent on resources—is on assisting Australian mining equipment, technology and services companies to provide services for the US$5.3 billion Oyu Tolgoi underground mine expansion. First production from the second stage is expected in 2020, and when fully operational the mine is expected to contribute even more to Mongolia’s GDP. Most of the 50 Australian companies with an active presence in Mongolia are contributing to the Oyu Tolgoi mine expansion through provision of professional and technical services and equipment. </p>
                        <h3 class="_-Level-3-Heading">South Asia</h3>
                        <p>Austrade’s South Asia regional grouping covers India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Already Australia’s fourth-largest export destination, the trade and investment relationship with South Asia continues to grow and expand. </p>
                        <h3 class="_-Level-3-Heading"><em>India</em></h3>
                        <p>Within South Asia, India’s sheer size, growth trajectory, positive demographics, rising middle class and significant economic potential position it as the future market for Australian businesses. </p>
                        <p>In 2017–18, Austrade’s initiatives and activities in-market were focused around navigating trade headwinds, providing critical market insights, and successfully capturing commercial opportunities and outcomes for Australian businesses. </p>
                        <p>Austrade focused its work in India on the key sectors of agribusiness; education and training; innovation and technology infrastructure, especially in transport, rail and smart cities; and mining and resources, including mining equipment, technology and services. Austrade works to increase Australia’s global share of foreign direct investment from India through a focus on large Indian corporates and resource and innovation opportunities.</p>
                        <p>Some of Austrade’s key initiatives and activities in India during the year included Australia Business Week in India in 2017; the Australian Cyber Security Mission to India; Group of Eight Australian universities’ engagement with Indian universities and corporates for research collaborations; a digital schools video competition to profile Australian education; and creating linkages between the Indian dairy sector and Australian training, genetics and dairy service providers. </p>
                        <p>Austrade serviced Australian businesses through innovative delivery mechanisms that included webinars and virtual innovation showcases on the agrifood, health and renewable energy sectors to showcase the Indian market and its potential to Australian businesses, and to build engagements between Australian and Indian companies. </p>
                        <h3 class="_-Level-3-Heading"><em>Pakistan</em></h3>
                        <p>Pakistan, the second-largest economy in South Asia, has continued to grow as economic reform strengthens and the security situation improves. Australian commercial involvement has largely been in the commodity, agribusiness, dairy and education sectors. </p>
                        <p>Austrade focused on brand recognition and in-market delivery of education programs in Pakistan, as well as expanding exports of pulses to Pakistan and capacity development in Pakistan’s dairy sector through a dairy initiative. </p>

                            <p>Munish Sharma is based in Chennai, India, where he commenced his posting as Trade Commissioner for Southern India in January 2018. </p>
                            <p>Munish has held numerous positions with Austrade over the past 20 years, both in Australia and internationally. Prior to taking up his posting in India, he was manager of the Advisory Services and Consumer sector in Sydney. He was also the national manager for Infrastructure and ICT teams in Australia. Munish started his Austrade career in 1998 as a locally engaged Business Development Manager in Chennai, soon after we expanded our presence to Southern India. </p>
                            <p>Munish is also responsible for Austrade’s business development initiatives in smart infrastructure in South Asia, focusing on urban development and transport. Urbanisation in India, which has the world’s largest rural population, brings enormous challenges and opportunities. The Indian Government has allocated US$20 billion to improve basic services, such as water, sewerage, sanitation and housing, in 100 chosen cities. Similarly, private and public investment is being made in developing roads, airports, ports and heavy haul transport. The majority of this work will be carried out by locals firms, but significant consulting opportunities exist for Australian specialists. </p>
                            <p>Munish holds a Bachelor of Business from the University of South Australia and a Master of Business Administration from the Australian Graduate School of Management (UNSW). He is fluent in Hindi. </p>

                        <p>In Bangladesh, Austrade’s activities and initiatives during the year focused on education, food and beverages (particularly grains and processed food), agribusiness, and commodities such as cotton. </p>
                        <p>Sri Lanka is growing in economic importance in the South Asia region. The Sri Lankan Government’s Vision 2025 economic strategy, which aims to raise Sri Lanka’s per capita income to US$5,000 by 2025, is expected to be a key driver of growth. Sri Lanka is already the largest market for Australian wines in South Asia and also a significant market for premium foods and education. Austrade’s activities and initiatives in Sri Lanka have been focused on higher education, premium food and beverages, dairy, and resources. </p>
                        <h2 class="_-Level-2-Heading-SPAN">Promoting Australian trade internationally</h2>
                        <h3 class="_-Level-3-Heading">Overview</h3>
                        <p>As the national trade and investment promotion agency, Austrade helps exporters identify and assess appropriate markets, overcome market challenges and develop their international presence. Austrade’s 2017–18 trade activity responded to, or was shaped by: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>significant demand generated by global demographic and technological trends </li>
                            <li>economic, political and/or regional factors providing new market opportunities</li>
                            <li>Australian businesses’ competitive advantages and their capability, capacity and preparedness to internationalise.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Austrade’s global footprint, networks and connections facilitate a clear understanding of current and emerging regional and market opportunities. They allow the organisation to provide on-the-ground and strategic support to Australian businesses in responding to global trends, capturing commercial opportunities and undertaking long-term market development. </p>
                        <h3 class="_-Level-3-Heading">Global trade environment</h3>
                        <p>After several challenging years for world trade, recent results have been more positive. Although volumes of world trade in goods and services grew by just 2.2 per cent in 2016 in what was the weakest outcome since the global financial crisis, a synchronised recovery in global economic growth contributed to a rebound in trade volumes, with growth picking up to a much stronger 5.1 per cent rate in 2017. As of July 2018, the International Monetary Fund was forecasting 4.8 per cent growth for goods and services trade volumes in 2018, followed by a predicted modest slowdown to 4.5 per cent in 2019.<sup id="fn_030-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#fn_030">5</a></sup></p>
                        <p>Looking further ahead, the outlook for international trade reflects a familiar mix of challenges and opportunities. On the challenging side of the ledger is what continues to be a problematic international political and policy environment for trade policy, some of which has taken the form of a trend rise in the prevalence of non-tariff barriers to trade, and some of which has shown up in an apparent decline in the international appetite for further trade liberalisation. More worryingly, at the time of writing, a series of high-profile trade disputes had also started to unfold. As well as representing an important headwind for global trade growth, these developments entail several significant risks, including an adverse demonstration effect (the danger that they encourage other economies to turn to protectionism), the possibility of existing measures triggering cascading trade disputes that would be large enough to upset world growth, and the prospect of damaging interactions within the geopolitical environment. </p>
                        <p>Another headwind for international trade is that the expansion of global value chains, previously a major driver of global trade growth, has shown signs of stalling in recent years. Many commentators see the current political environment as hostile to businesses continuing to pursue this model, while the outlook for global value chains is also being influenced by technological change that may be reducing the relative importance of international labour cost arbitrage, as well as by structural changes in the Chinese economy. </p>
                        <p>More optimistically, the decline in trade costs triggered by technological innovation continues to lower the barriers to access international markets for small and medium-sized enterprises in particular, and at the same time innovation has also helped encourage the growing importance of cross-border trade in services and data. Both trends should provide important support for trade growth in the medium term, although the latter in particular raises some important measurement issues around the ability of our current trade statistics to accurately capture new modes of international exchange. </p>
                        <p>Another important stimulus to trade flows is the continued expansion of an emerging global middle class, representing a rise in global prosperity that creates an important ongoing opportunity for new market growth, particularly in emerging Asia. </p>
                        <h3 class="_-Level-3-Heading">Australia’s exporter community</h3>
                        <p>According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), there were 51,992 goods exporters in Australia in 2016–17.<sup id="fn_029-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#fn_029">6</a></sup> The 2016–17 figures showed a modest rise of 700 in the number of exporters, following three consecutive years of increases running in the thousands. Those three years had marked a significant break with previous experience: for the seven years between 2006–07 and 2012–13, the overall exporter count had been relatively stable (although this had disguised quite a lot of churn at the smaller end of the exporter size distribution), but the latest result suggests the surge in numbers has slowed. </p>
                        <p>Exporters can broadly be classified into three groups: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Large (or ‘mega’) exporters</strong>generate individual export revenues of $50 million or more, and account for most of Australia’s export value. The composition of exporters within this group is relatively stable, with modest numbers of entries and exits from year to year. In 2016–17, this group comprised just 437 goods exporters, which together accounted for more than 88 per cent of the value of all goods exports that year. </li>
                            <li class="_-bullet-list _idGenParaOverride-1"><strong>Small to medium-sized exporters (or SMEx)</strong>generate individual export revenues between $250,000 and $50 million. This group comprised 10,462 goods exporters in 2016–17. As with large exporters, the composition of this group is relatively stable across each year, although there is more churn than in the mega-exporter category. The SMEx category accounted for about 11 per cent of goods export value in 2016–17. </li>
                            <li><strong>Micro-exporters</strong>generate individual export revenues of less than $250,000 and account for the majority of Australian exporters. Despite their weight of numbers, micro-exporters account for a very low share of total exports by value, and membership of this group exhibits a large amount of churn. In 2016–17, for example, this category accounted for about 79 per cent of goods exporters (or more than 41,000 individual businesses), but generated less than 1 per cent of goods exports by value. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="_-Level-3-Heading">Australia’s exports, by composition and direction</h3>
                        <p>International trade continues to make a significant contribution to the Australian economy. As of March 2018, trade in goods and services was equivalent to more than 44 per cent of nominal GDP, while the ratio of exports of goods and services to GDP stood at 22.7 per cent.<sup id="fn_028-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#fn_028">7</a></sup></p>
                        <p>The better global backdrop in 2017 described above was also reflected in our national trade results, as Australia saw the total value of our exports of goods and services jump by almost 15 per cent last year, reaching a total of $386.7 billion.<sup id="fn_027-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#fn_027">8</a></sup></p>
                        <p>Total export growth in 2017 was boosted by stronger commodity prices and higher volumes of resource exports, with exports of iron ore (up more than 17 per cent in dollar terms), coal (up 35 per cent), aluminium ores (up more than 30 per cent) and natural gas (jumping by 43 per cent) all enjoying marked increases last year. </p>
                        <p>After a good 2016, the services sector, especially the education sector, put in another decent performance in 2017, with the value of services exports up by almost 9 per cent. The value of education-related travel services rose by more than 17 per cent over the year, although personal travel services (excluding education) were almost flat, growing by just 0.4 per cent. Exports of telecommunications, computer and information services also posted another year of healthy growth in 2017, expanding by more than 11 per cent, while exports of financial services rose by more than 17 per cent. </p>
                        <p>The overall value of manufacturing exports rose by almost 3 per cent last year, while the value of exports of rural goods rebounded, growing by nearly 14 per cent. </p>
                        <p>By market, China continued to be the most important destination for Australian exports in 2017, accounting for 30 per cent of total exports, and experiencing an increase in export values of more than 21 per cent. Other key markets to see large export growth included Japan (our second-largest export market with a 12 per cent share, and with exports up nearly 23 per cent in dollar terms), India (up almost 33 per cent), Hong Kong (up 17 per cent) and Korea (up more than 14 per cent). Exports to ASEAN were up by almost 14 per cent in value terms, with very rapid growth to Thailand and Vietnam in particular. </p>
                        <p>After dramatic growth in 2016 (when exports surged thanks to a strong increase in the value of gold exports), exports to the United Kingdom dropped by more than 25 per cent last year, which in turn contributed to a drop in overall exports to the European Union by 9 per cent.</p>

                    <h3>Australia’s internationally active businesses</h3>
                    <p>Australia’s International Business Survey (AIBS) is the largest undertaking of its kind in Australia, capturing current conditions and future outlooks of internationally engaged businesses in Australia. The survey is conducted by the Export Council of Australia with the support of Austrade and the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation. </p>
                    <p>This year’s survey was implemented by market research company AMR between April and May 2018, and it captured responses from 629 internationally active businesses drawn from 19 industry sectors operating across more than 92 international markets. </p>
                    <p>Consistent with the results of previous surveys, AIBS 2018 presents a diversified and well-experienced business community involved in a diverse range of international activities (Figure 10). Eighty-two per cent of respondents earned international revenue from more than one country, with 30 per cent earning revenue from more than 11 countries. The top markets for international revenue for respondents were the were the United States, China, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and Singapore. </p>
                    <p>Respondents had a very positive outlook for their businesses going forward (66 per cent said their future outlook was better than the previous two years), with 72 per cent planning to increase employee headcount by an average of 41 per cent. </p>
                    <p>AIBS 2018 captures the views of internationally experienced small and medium-sized enterprises. About 74 per cent of survey respondents had fewer than 40 employees, while 46 per cent have been earning international revenues for a decade or longer. </p>
                    <p>AIBS 2018 also surveyed companies not currently engaged in international activities. The main reasons for not engaging in international activities were a focus on domestic scalability (36 per cent), followed by lack of international leads or contacts (32 per cent). </p>
                    <p>More information about AIBS 2018 is available from the Austrade website at <a href="https://www.austrade.gov.au/">austrade.gov.au</a>. </p>

                    <h3 class="_-Level-3-Heading">Connecting Australian exporters and opportunities</h3>
                    <p id="pp55">Austrade provides exporters with relevant and commercially useful information and advice, and access to its in-market networks, including decision-makers, international customers and relevant contacts. These services help exporters deal with the language, culture, business practice and regulatory barriers to international expansion, reducing the time, cost and risk of doing business overseas. Clients are supported by onshore and offshore teams and through partnerships with stakeholders. </p>
                    <p>In 2017–18, Austrade provided 12,017 general and tailored services to 4,803 Australian organisations to help them access opportunities overseas. Austrade also provides quality referrals to third-party professionals and business service providers when they are better placed to assist Australian organisations with a specific need. In 2017–18, Austrade provided 596 referrals to 466 Australian organisations. </p>
                    <p>Austrade’s First-Tier Services team triages enquiries, and provides practical advice to help Australian companies assess their international readiness, and to guide them through their options as they pursue international markets for their products and services. In 2017–18, the team delivered export advice through 10,177 emails and 3,760 phone calls. This led to 210 new client contacts and 340 internal referrals for further assistance to Austrade’s global network. </p>
                    <p>Austrade's Advisory Services and Consumer team provides practical advice to help Australian companies assess their international readiness, and to guide them through their options as they pursue international markets for their products and services. In 2016–17, the Advisory Services and Consumer team delivered export advice through 9,669 emails and 4,652 phone calls. This led to 303 new client contacts and 463 internal referrals for further assistance to Austrade's global network.</p>
                    <div class="case-study-alt">
                        <h3><strong>Challenge:</strong> Strengthen export pathways and identify alternative markets</h3>
                        <p>The international business landscape continues to change rapidly, driven by global megatrends. This provides opportunities for Australia to strengthen export pathways and identify alternative markets, including trade in services. </p>
                        <p>A growing and ageing global population is delivering healthcare opportunities in established markets. The Austrade-led Australian Life Sciences Mission to the United States in June 2018 connected Australian data analytics and clinical research capability, pharmaceutical and surgical technologies expertise, and broader medtech innovation to the US healthcare and biotech ecosystems in Boston, Philadelphia and Houston. </p>
                        <p>Growing global emphasis on environmental protection and social licence to operate, particularly in the mining community, provided Australian businesses with opportunities to showcase their world-class environmental technologies and standards, and education and training capabilities. Austrade has delivered to Colombia’s largest mine, Cerrejón Mine, productivity and operational efficiency gains through Australian technology solutions that include assisting with better utilisation and maintenance of its mining equipment. The mine has also drawn on Australian expertise in blasting improvement technologies, water and dust management equipment, and road resurfacing programs. </p>
                        <p>Austrade’s advice and in-market support in a changing economic landscape has never been more valuable.</p>
                    </div>
                    <h3 class="_-Level-3-Heading ParaOverride-39">Linking Australian and international ecosystems</h3>
                    <p>Austrade sees significant opportunities to further develop strong innovation connections at many levels that link the Australian innovation ecosystem with other ecosystems to deliver long-term, sustainable and high-value results for the Australian economy. </p>
                    <p>Austrade’s Landing Pad program presence in five global innovation hub locations provides a cost-effective in-market option for high-potential startups and scaleups. </p>
                    <p>In March 2018, Austrade led a trade and investment mission to the World Agri-Tech Innovation Summit in San Francisco, followed by a side visit to Chicago. The five-day mission showcased Australia’s agtech ecosystem and solutions to increase the productivity, sustainability and value of agricultural production. A broad range of engagements and activities included a CSIRO-sponsored Australian innovation breakfast, which brought together Australian businesses and an audience of potential investors, strategic partners and customers. </p>
                    <h3 class="_-Level-3-Heading">Achieving outcomes in global value chains</h3>
                    <p>The January 2018 release of the Australian Government’s Defence Export Strategy presents substantial opportunities for Australian companies to enter international global value chains. The strategy will drive a more globally competitive, innovative and productive Australian defence industry and aims for Australia to become a top-tier defence exporting nation within the next decade. </p>
                    <p>Austrade contributed significantly to the strategy development and will continue to assist the growth of the Australian defence industry export sector, in accordance with Australia’s stringent export control requirements. </p>
                    <p>The signing of a memorandum of understanding with the Department of Defence in May 2018 formalises Austrade’s partnership responsibilities, including: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>supporting Defence’s procurement programs, Team Defence Australia activities and the global supply chain programs </li>
                        <li>sourcing commercial opportunities for Australian defence businesses across more diverse geographies and end-use industries </li>
                        <li>supporting the identification of capabilities from non-defence sectors, which may provide fundamental input to sovereign defence capability </li>
                        <li>supporting the efforts of prime contractors and their major suppliers to invest in Australia and establish operations, which will allow these investors to support key defence contracts, and other related commercial sectors </li>
                        <li>funding and collaborative staff arrangements to support these activities. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This approach also facilitated greater engagement with Western European markets. The announcement of Naval Group (then DCNS) as the preferred supplier of the $50 billion SEA1000 future submarines contract represents substantial opportunities for Australian companies to enter the global value chains of not only Naval Group, but also its tier one and tier two suppliers in Australia and internationally across multiple sectors.</p>
                    <h3>Facilitating business missions and events</h3>
                    <p>Austrade facilitates a number of international business events, including market briefings, information sessions, minister-led business missions and tailored sectoral delegations to overseas markets, to directly connect Australian exporters and institutions with potential customers.</p>
                    <p>During 2016–17, Austrade facilitated 355 trade-related events, which included a number of outbound delegations, information sessions about the Export Market Development Grants scheme, and seminars on the free trade agreement program.</p>
                    <p>Austrade also facilitated a number of minister-led business missions. For more information, <a href="#pp70">see page 70</a>.</p>
                    <h3 class="_-Level-3-Heading">Growing Australian services engagement in Asia and the Pacific</h3>
                    <p>Australia has one of the most services-intensive economies across Asia and the Pacific, providing significant opportunities for increased integration of Australia's services sector into the global economy.</p>
                    <p>Austrade's cross-sectoral services strategy focuses on using existing relationships with international customers to cross-sell additional Australian value-added services and technologies. It also aims to assist Australian companies to establish a presence closer to global customer procurement and production hubs and facilitate access for Australian services and solutions onto global technology platforms.</p>
                    <p>As a subset of this cross-sectoral approach, Austrade has continued to support the international expansion of the financial services industry as a major contributor to the Australian economy. In 2016–17, a key theme for the sector was the development of a Fintech Asia Passport. This Austrade-led concept is focused on assisting financial technology firms to overcome regulatory barriers across Asia, making the Asian market more scalable, and promoting Australia's fintech capability, standards regulation and policies across the region.</p>
                    <p>Austrade also worked closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to deliver the inaugural Fintech Regulatory Bootcamp in Singapore in October 2016.</p>
                    <p>The bootcamp was attended by over 40 regulators from ASEAN, Australian industry, and representatives from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, and led to consideration being given for Australia leading the formation of a regional fintech association.</p>
                    <p>Separately, Austrade has been supporting Australian screen organisations, with a particular focus on opportunities in China and Korea. Austrade has been working with Screen Australia, Ausfilm, Screen Producers Australia and other industry organisations to promote awareness of the Australian industry offshore, including by publishing a <em>Screen Production</em> industry capability report. It was translated into Mandarin for a visit by members of the sector to China for the Beijing International Film Festival in April 2017.</p>
                    <h3 class="_-Level-3-Heading">Highlighting Australia's export capabilities</h3>
                    <p>A core activity for Austrade is demonstrating Australia's comparative advantages to overseas customers. Austrade has developed a library of industry capability reports that are used to promote Australia's industry sector strengths and capabilities to potential customers. Austrade has 50 industry capability reports within its library, including its three most recent reports—<em>Cyber Security; Aviation Education and Training; and Microgrids, Smartgrids and Energy Storage Solutions</em>.</p>
                    <p>Austrade also connects customers and exporters through its Australian Suppliers Directory, a web-based tool available at austrade.gov.au, to promote Australia's high-quality products, services and solutions. This database allows customers to search through 6,800 Australian exporting organisations, across 17 industries, by keyword, sector or company name.</p>

                        <h3>Austrade helps turn opportunities into reality in aged care</h3>
                        <p>With expertise in health and aged care delivery, Australia is well placed to meet the booming demand in this sector. This demand has been driven by factors such as population ageing, rising rates of chronic disease and an increasing number of middle-class consumers seeking access to quality care.</p>
                        <p>Austrade has developed close working relationships with a growing number of health and aged care services companies. This, teamed with a strong understanding of local markets and health systems, is helping to create opportunities for Australian companies to develop partnerships across Asia.</p>
                        <p>Sapphire Group, a senior living, home care and nursing care provider based in Victoria, has worked closely with Austrade and the Victorian Government. In May 2017, Sapphire Group signed a joint venture agreement with a subsidiary of the Hong Kong-listed Fosun Group. The group will operate a new aged care project in Beijing that will be managed under Australian quality standards and will help meet the culture and care needs of China's high-end senior living market.</p>
                        <p>Both organisations participated in the first Australia-China Aged Care Summit, organised by Austrade, in Beijing in November 2015, meeting during business networking sessions held at the event. Australia Week in China, held in April 2016, presented another opportunity for the two organisations to further strengthen their relationship and discuss commercial opportunities.</p>
                        <p>Partnerships like this will help governments and private providers to meet the challenges of the health and aged care sector, with the need for health, aged care and lifestyle services greater than ever before.</p>

                    <h3 class="_-Level-3-Heading">Connecting Australia through e-commerce</h3>
                    <p>In 2016–17, Austrade expanded its cross-border e-commerce focus on food and consumer products to include Australian service and technology companies that provide solutions for overseas platforms and retailers, or that help Australian brands sell overseas.</p>
                    <p>Austrade also signed a strategic collaboration agreement with Alibaba (Australia and New Zealand), China's largest online retailer. The two-year agreement will promote Australian products on Alibaba-operated e-commerce and media sites, and will provide streamlined access to Alibaba services for Australian companies and startups. Under the agreement, Austrade and Alibaba will co-develop a marketing plan to promote new Australian products, with a focus on fresh and perishable produce.</p>
                    <p>Alibaba will create a dedicated promotional channel for Australian companies on youku.com, a video sharing website with 500 million active users. The agreement also includes training of Australian small to medium-sized enterprises, inbound tourism payments and 'AliLaunch', a program that will use Alibaba's cloud computing platform to help companies commercialise in China.</p>
                    <h3>Approving exemptions under section 23AF of the <em>Income Tax Assessment Act 1936</em></h3>
                    <p>Supporting the work of the Australian Taxation Office, Austrade has the delegation to determine approved project status under section 23AF of the <em>Income Tax Assessment Act 1936</em>. This allows individuals who worked overseas on an approved project, for a continuous period of at least 91 days, to be exempt from Australian income tax. While Austrade approves project applications, the granting of the exemption rests with the Australian Taxation Office.</p>
                    <p>This exemption typically applies to projects in countries where individuals do not pay income tax, or where income tax is not levied on foreign workers because the project is funded by an international development agency (such as the World Bank). It can enhance the competitiveness of international tender bids by Australian organisations, as well as strengthen Australian companies' capabilities, broaden employees' skills, and raise the international profile of Australian industry.</p>
                    <p>In 2016–17, Austrade granted 82 approvals in response to 83 applications from 21 applicants. This compares to 85 approvals, 85 applications and 20 applicants in 2015–16.</p>
                    <p>Approved projects were located in the following regions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Middle East—36 (44 per cent)</li>
                        <li>Indo-Pacific—32 (39 per cent)</li>
                        <li>Africa—12 (15 per cent)</li>
                        <li>Central Asia—2 (2 per cent).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In 2016–17, 37 approved projects (45 per cent) were commercially funded, while the remaining 45 (55 per cent) were funded by international development agencies.</p>
                    <h3 class="_-Level-3-Heading">Austrade's TradeStart network</h3>
                    <p>Austrade's network of 28 TradeStart offices broadens the reach of the agency's trade and education promotion services, with a strong emphasis on regional Australia.</p>
                    <p>The network is jointly delivered by state, territory and local governments, industry associations and chambers of commerce, with each partner carefully selected through a tender process. The next tender process will occur during 2017–18. To complement the delivery of Austrade services, TradeStart partner organisations offer assistance for exporters and potential exporters via a local adviser who can help them navigate overseas markets, and provide direct access to Austrade's overseas network.</p>
                    <p>In 2016–17, Austrade opened a new TradeStart office in Bundaberg and reopened another office in Geelong, through support and funding provided by the Queensland and Victorian state governments.</p>
                    <p>The TradeStart team also continued its outreach on the benefits of free trade agreements and worked on more sophisticated, often multiple-market projects, with a range of small to medium-sized exporters. TradeStart locations and partner organisations are listed in <a href="../node/3712.html#figa1">Appendix A</a>.</p>

                        <p>Craig Ford is an export adviser on the Gold Coast. He provides practical advice to local business as part of Austrade's TradeStart network. Craig works with business across a range of sectors, including mining, technology, health, marine, food, consumer and services.</p>
                        <p>Prior to joining TradeStart four years ago, Craig gained hands-on experience at the University of Queensland's ilab incubator in the startup phase of his business.</p>
                        <p>'The Gold Coast is a high-energy, small business city with a great entrepreneurial mindset. The TradeStart role is a very privileged position which I enjoy immensely, allowing me to work alongside and participate in the export growth of businesses across a wide range of industry sectors', said Craig.</p>
                        <p>Craig also assists Australian exporters to sell online through websites and e-commerce platforms. In 2017, Craig brought together the City of Gold Coast and Austrade's overseas network to deliver a series of in-depth workshops to local exporters about how to get started selling online. He is also responsible for managing the delivery of the City of Gold Coast Council's three annual trade missions, its Emerging Exporter training program and its Export Assistance Scheme for current and new exporters.</p>
                        <p>Craig holds a degree in international business from Griffith University.</p>

                        <p>Toowoomba is fast becoming a regional export hub. Here, Austrade partners with the Queensland Government to deliver both state and federal government export assistance to local businesses through the TradeStart network, building strong relationships with other organisations to deliver a comprehensive suite of services to businesses.</p>
                        <p>In January 2017, Geraldine Doumany, TradeStart Adviser, Toowoomba, worked with the local Export Club, managed by Food Leaders Australia, as well as Toowoomba and Surat Basin Enterprise (TSBE), to deliver a free trade agreement (FTA) outreach seminar at Brisbane West Wellcamp Airport. Over 150 people attended, making it the largest FTA outreach event delivered by Austrade during the year.</p>
                        <p>'The FTA seminar drew on the strengths of both organisations, and by partnering with Austrade, it allowed TSBE and Food Leaders Australia to share in an event that brought leading global trade advisers and political leaders to the region', said Shane Charles, Executive Chairman of TSBE, the driving force behind Food Leaders Australia.</p>
                        <p>TSBE also received government assistance through the Free Trade Agreement Training Provider Grant program to deliver targeted FTA training to over 90 businesses in the region.</p>
                        <p>Almost half of the attendees were new to exporting, hoping to learn more about benefiting from Australia's FTAs and the new international air freight services to Hong Kong that connect the region to Asia and the rest of the world.

                    <p id="pp60">Each year, Austrade undertakes a comprehensive Service Improvement Study to assess its service delivery and identify areas to improve its services. The study is conducted independently and results are delivered quarterly. A brief follow-up survey is also conducted to measure the ongoing benefit of Austrade services, including commercial outcomes achieved 12 months after an interaction with Austrade.</p>
                    <p>In 2016–17, Austrade's Service Improvement Study found 89 per cent of all clients were satisfied with their recent dealings with Austrade. Austrade's net promoter score is +40 compared to +29 in 2015–16. These results show Austrade's clients continue to value the services it provides and are advocates for Austrade in their business networks.</p>
                    <p>This survey also collected detailed feedback on Austrade's performance, including the following results:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>87 per cent of all clients said they achieved a commercial outcome within 12 months of working with Austrade.</li>
                        <li>76 per cent of trade clients rated the contribution Austrade has made to their international business activities over the past 12 months as either positive, significant or critical.</li>

                    <p>Australia's nation brand—<em>Australia Unlimited</em>—provides a confident, contemporary and consistent representation of Australia's broad capabilities. Exporters, startups, small to medium-sized enterprises, education institutions and students can benefit from a strong nation brand. <em>Australia Unlimited </em>assets, including its visual brand mark and digital publishing platforms, continue to support the whole-of-government approach to enriching and enhancing Australia's international reputation as a global business partner and citizen.</p>
                    <p>In 2016–17, a series of videos was developed showcasing Australian innovation and capability in food and agricultural technology, medical technology, services and technology, and advanced manufacturing. The videos were produced in English, simplified Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese and Spanish and can be viewed on the <em>Australia Unlimited</em> website, <a href="https://www.australiaunlimited.com/" target="_blank">australiaunlimited.com</a>, and the Austrade website, <a href="https://austrade.gov.au/" target="_blank">austrade.gov.au</a>.</p>
                    <p>Artwork for a series of <em>Australia Unlimited </em>posters promoting Australian capabilities, such as medical technology, renewable energy, startups and digital technology, was also developed and is available for download from Austrade's creative library, ibrand.</p>
                    <p>Fifty-five new stories profiling Australians and Australian achievements were published under a Creative Commons licence on a number of digital platforms, including both the <em>Australia Unlimited</em> and Austrade websites, as well as Austrade's social media accounts on Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter. The Brand Australia program continues to work closely with partner agencies, such as the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Tourism Australia and CSIRO, to extend the reach of Brand Australia initiatives, including the distribution of <em>Australia </em><em>Unlimited </em>stories.</p>
                    <p>Brand Australia's increased efforts on social media, combined with successful campaigns on Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn, led to an increase of social media followers from 20,625 to 23,946—up 16 per cent.

                    <h2>Working across government and with partners</h2>
                    <p id="pp68">Austrade provides a global and commercial perspective in its policy advice to government. The agency's insights are informed by its presence in the commercial capitals of international markets. Through its people, in-house economic research and analysis, access to firm-level commercial knowledge, and partnerships with other Australian Government agencies, state and territory governments, and industry stakeholders, Austrade can distil insight in a way that is informed and relevant to the audience.</p>
                    <p>Austrade uses the intelligence and insights gained from its network and interactions with investors, exporters and customers to inform and contribute to Australian Government policymaking. In particular, Austrade works across government to coordinate and provide input into domestic reforms to make the Australian tourism industry and education sector more competitive, while feedback from its large offshore network enables Austrade to help shape Australia's export and investment agendas.</p>
                    <p>Austrade provides advice to government directly through the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, and through officials-level forums with a broad range of Australian Government and state and territory government departments responsible for, or with an interest in, trade, tourism, investment and international education.</p>
                    <h3 class="_-Level-3-Heading">Working across government</h3>
                    <p>Austrade manages a series of cross-jurisdictional forums with Australian state and territory ministers and officials to coordinate trade, tourism, investment and international education activities.</p>
                    <p>The Senior Officials Trade and Investment Group and the Australian Standing Committee on Tourism meet biannually and support high-level ministerial meetings. Co-chaired by executive directors from Austrade and deputy secretaries from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and attended by state and territory counterparts, the Senior Officials Trade and Investment Group met once and the Australian Standing Committee on Tourism met twice in 2016–17. These meetings focused on giving effect to the outcomes and decisions arising from the Trade and Investment Ministers Meeting and the Tourism Ministers Meeting, coordinating trade, tourism and investment policy and promotion, and sharing better practice among jurisdictions.</p>
                    <p>At a ministerial level, Austrade continued to support the Trade and Investment Ministers Meeting and the Tourism Ministers Meeting. Chaired by the Hon Steven Ciobo MP, Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, and attended by the Minister's state and territory counterparts, the Trade and Investment Ministers Meeting met once and the Tourism Ministers Meeting met twice in 2016–17. Topics discussed included export and investment opportunities within global value chains, promoting the benefits of trade and foreign direct investment, the Tourism 2020 strategy, the China-Australia Year of Tourism 2017, and implementation plans for the Regional Tourism Infrastructure Investment Attraction Strategy.</p>
                    <p>These ministerial meetings and senior officials groups also provide strategic direction to the operationally focused National Trade Working Group, the National Investment Advisory Board, and the Tourism Access Working Group. Chaired by Austrade, these forums provide opportunities for Commonwealth, state and territory practitioners to collaborate on trade, tourism and investment policy and promotional activities, and improve access throughout the tourism sector through aviation policy, visa reform and visitor experience. The National Trade Working Group and the National Investment Advisory Board each met twice, and the Tourism Access Working Group met once in 2016–17.</p>
                    <p>Austrade continued to chair the International Education Marketing Forum with states and territories. The forum met twice in 2016–17. The forum's objective is to coordinate and maximise efforts across jurisdictions to market and promote Australian education internationally—a key theme arising from the Australian International Education 2025 strategy.</p>
                    <h3 class="_-Level-3-Heading">Working with partners and the business community</h3>
                    <p id="pp69">Austrade also works collaboratively with other organisations to help increase its reach into the business community.</p>
                    <p>Austrade has a longstanding working relationship with the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (Efic). Austrade and Efic share a common objective—assisting Australian small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to expand into international markets. Austrade and Efic cross-refer clients and co-host events to promote export opportunities, and a number of Efic staff members are co-located in Austrade's state offices, including two staff based in Adelaide, three in Brisbane, four in Melbourne and two in Perth. In recent years, Austrade has also partnered with Efic in the delivery of onshore events for Australian SMEs, such as Operating in Asia forums<em> </em>and the Following Your Customer to Market series. Efic is closely involved in Austrade's minister-led business missions, is a platinum sponsor of the Australian Export Awards, and is a contributor to Austrade's free trade agreement seminar series.</p>
                    <p>Together with Efic, Austrade also partners with the Export Council of Australia and the University of Technology Sydney Business School to conduct the annual Australia's International Business Survey, which is one of the largest and most in-depth surveys of its kind. For more information on the survey, <a href="#pp54">see page 54</a>.</p>
                    <p>Austrade also works closely with industry bodies to extend trade and investment relationships in overseas markets. In April 2017, a small delegation from Infrastructure Partnerships Australia and Austrade visited Hong Kong and Beijing to meet with major infrastructure investors and constructors. The meetings provided an opportunity to discuss the development of infrastructure in Australia and China, showcase the pipeline of infrastructure projects on the Australia and New Zealand Infrastructure Pipeline, and discuss Chinese expertise, particularly in road and rail projects across China.</p>
                    <h3>Supporting new policy initiatives</h3>
                    <p>During 2016–17, Austrade contributed to new government policy initiatives, including the Australian Government's National Innovation and Science Agenda. As part of this initiative, Austrade established five Landing Pads in global innovation hotspots to support market-ready startups, launching the final three Landing Pads in Shanghai, Berlin and Singapore in 2016–17, adding to those already opened in San Francisco and Tel Aviv during 2015–16 (<a href="../node/3687/node/3687/node/3687.html#pp88">see page 88</a>).</p>
                    <p>Austrade assisted Innovation and Science Australia (ISA) in the development of ISA's 2030 Strategic Plan for Australia's innovation, science and research system. Austrade seconded an officer to a taskforce to develop the plan, providing insights from an export and investment perspective. The ISA plan is scheduled for release in late 2017.</p>
                    <p>Austrade has also seconded an officer to a taskforce in the Department of the Prime Minister of Cabinet to assist with preparations for the ASEAN-­Australia Special Summit to take place in Sydney in March 2018. Austrade, with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, is updating the popular <em>Why ASEAN and Why Now</em> publication for the business summit, one of the key lead-in events.</p>
                    <p>Austrade provided advice to the Department of Immigration and Border Protection as part of its review of visa policy settings in relation to the competitiveness of Australia's tourism and education sectors and the attraction of high-value foreign direct investment, including through the investor visa frameworks.</p>
                    <p>As part of a $16.6 million funding package provided in the 2016–17 Budget, Austrade will continue to deliver seminars to promote awareness of the business opportunities created by Australia's free trade agreements.</p>
                    <p>Development of a foreign policy white paper commenced in December 2016, with the Hon Julie Bishop MP, Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the Hon Steven Ciobo MP, Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, launching the process. Austrade has been working closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on its development. The white paper will serve as a roadmap for the Australian Government's international engagement over the next decade.</p>

                    <p id="pp70">Minister-led business missions continue to play an important role in promoting Australian export capabilities and investment opportunities. Austrade plays a central role in coordinating Commonwealth and state and territory government participation in the development and implementation of business programs to showcase Australian capability in key international markets.</p>
                    <p>During 2016–17, Austrade coordinated seven minister-led business missions, which included a significant Australia Week promotion in Indonesia in March 2017. This brings the total number of minister-led business missions organised by Austrade since March 2014 to 35 (Table 9).</p>
                    <p>While these large-scale events have been successful in promoting Australia's interests and delivering market insights to large numbers of delegates, research has shown repeating the model for future events in these markets is likely to have less commercial impact. In response, during 2016, Austrade revised Australia Week events to be smaller in scale, sector-specific and focused on driving commercial outcomes through tailored business matching opportunities.</p>
                    <p>Research also measured delegate satisfaction levels around the focus and delivery of the missions, as well as testing if objectives for participation were met. Results for this period reflect consistently high levels of satisfaction across all measures, including following the move to deliver smaller scale, sector-specific missions.</p>

                    <h4 class="_-Level-4-Heading"><em>Iran</em></h4>
                    <p>In September 2016, the Hon Steven Ciobo MP, Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, led a business mission to Iran. The visit provided delegates with a broad understanding of the opportunities and challenges of doing business in Iran. The visit followed the lifting of sanctions against Iran and provided delegates with an opportunity to engage with the market in areas such as water management, food and agribusiness, education and training, health and medical services, mining, oil and gas, and tourism.</p>

                    <p>In February 2017, Mr Ciobo led a business mission to China to celebrate the China-Australia Year of Tourism 2017. He was accompanied by a delegation of CEOs from the aviation and tourism sectors, including key international gateways and selected regional airports. Engagement with Chinese stakeholders helped to underpin and expand the already strong commercial tourism and trade connections between Australia and China.</p>
                    <h4 class="_-Level-4-Heading"><em>Indonesia</em></h4>
                    <p>In March 2017, Mr Ciobo led a large business delegation to Indonesia for Indonesia Australia Business Week. Delegates participated in tailored industry programs covering food and agribusiness supply chains, financial services and technologies, resilient cities, vocational education and training, and tourism promotion and destination development.

                        <h3>Indonesia Australia Business Week</h3>
                        <p>In March 2017, the Hon Steven Ciobo MP, Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, led a major trade mission of 123 Australian business delegates to Indonesia for Indonesia Australia Business Week (IABW). Events were delivered across five locations—Jakarta, Surabaya, Malang, Lombok and Denpasar. Five sectoral streams—vocational education and training; tourism; financial services and technology; water and sustainable urban design; and agribusiness supply chains—matched Australian expertise to commercial potential in Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>The Hon Malcolm Turnbull MP, Prime Minister, and a number of other Australian Government and state government ministers also participated in IABW, as well as 980 Indonesian customers. IABW provided many opportunities to profile Australian export capability and investment opportunities, and for attendees to meet and network with Australian delegates.</p>
                        <p>IABW was officially opened by a gala dinner, which was attended by around 480 guests, and featured successful partnerships between Australia and Indonesia, including the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association Pastoral Program, Pod Chocolate, and the West Australian Ballet and Ballet.id.</p>
                        <p>The IABW program included a strong focus on innovation, with the financial services and technologies stream introducing Australian financial technology innovation and capability to Indonesia's budding financial and venture capital scene. The Innovation Showcase, a program highlight, gave Australian delegates a high-profile platform to pitch directly to Indonesian venture capital firms and banks.</p>
                        <p>Building on the success of IABW 2015, the 2017 program delivered smaller and more focused events for each sector, creating more opportunities for delegates to network with Indonesian customers. This revised approach was well received, with delegates reporting a high degree of satisfaction through an online survey conducted at the conclusion of the program.</p>
                        <p>Eighty-three per cent of respondents reported most or all of their objectives for participation in IABW had been met, with the same number indicating they achieved or expected to achieve a new business relationship in the next three months. All respondents thought participating in IABW had delivered an advantage to their organisation, and 79 per cent said they expected to return to Indonesia to follow up on opportunities identified during IABW in the next 6 to 12 months. The additional comments provided by delegates were very positive, with one delegate adding, 'this is really what government support for business is all about'. This view was echoed by other participants, with 99 per cent rating Austrade's performance as either extremely good, very good or good.</p>

                    <p>In April 2017, the Hon Josh Frydenberg MP, Minister for the Environment and Energy, led a delegation to Israel to enhance innovation and boost trade and investment between Australia and Israel, with an emphasis on collaboration in the environmental, renewable and clean technology sectors. Participating technology companies and startups were provided with a unique opportunity to gain insights into the Israeli innovation ecosystem and to attend a week-long curated program at the Landing Pad in Tel Aviv.</p>
                    <h4 class="_-Level-4-Heading"><em>Japan</em></h4>
                    <p>In April 2017, Mr Ciobo led a delegation to Japan. Delegates participated in events that showcased Australian expertise across the food and beverage, financial services and life sciences sectors. The visit included bilateral meetings and a number of business-focused events designed to promote Brand Australia and advance Australia's business interests in Japan.</p>
                    <h4 class="_-Level-4-Heading"><em>Saudi Arabia</em></h4>
                    <p>Also in April 2017, Mr Ciobo led a business delegation to Saudi Arabia to explore opportunities for Australian trade and investment, particularly in the defence, mining and financial services sectors. The program included a series of meetings, business briefings and networking opportunities for delegates to meet with Saudi government and industry representatives in each of the sectors.</p>
                    <h4 class="_-Level-4-Heading"><em>United States</em></h4>
                    <p>In May 2017, Mr Ciobo led a delegation to the 20th Milken Institute Global Conference, held in Los Angeles.

The ABS cautions that its total figure is a 'careful estimate' as there is no accurate methodology to calculate the overlap between goods and services exporters. In addition, the count of exporters of services only provides a breakdown by size and number for services exporters, accounting for about 38 per cent of service exports by value, and excludes from the count exporters of a large range of service exports, including consumption by tourists and students in Australia.</p>
